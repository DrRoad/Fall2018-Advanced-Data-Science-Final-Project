# Applied Data Science Fall 2018 by Columbia University

This repository is the script for final project, "How to predict future price of a security", submitted to Advanced Data Science offered in Fall 2018 semester at Columbia University.

# Prerequisite

This project requires reader to have a broad range of knowledge including but not limited to (1) financial accounting, (2) time-series analysis, (3) predictive modeling skills, (4) coding in R, (5) design software package such as R Shiny, and (6) parallel computing using shell script.

# Abstract

Project summary: What is tomorrow's stock price? Under big data era, what searching technique can we use to grasp the useful information so that we can minimize our prediction error predicting a regression problem? This project studies price actions in capital market as a random walk from limit theorems. Through clear construction, we derive algorithms from a series of theorems to create standardized buy signals given a trader's committed frequency to participate in the market. Using such processed data, we can use influence measure, I-score, to select robust stock clusters to construct portfolio. Simulation result shows under the same risk profile a $1,000 initial investment returns $5,000 while the same time S&P500 returns less than $1,500. Empirical evidence show results of on average 97% error reduction.

# Acknowledge

This project provide fair and robust analysis in predicting security prices. However, money management is more of art than science. We have not disclosed related strategy in game planning when it comes to risk management. Hence, this project does not serve as investment advise and nor are we responsible for any monetary losses from investment decisions by any audience. The risk of money management subject to your investment is solely your responsibility.

We also want to thank Professor Ying Liu and Professor Tian Zheng for hosting lectures of Advanced Data Science this semester. It is with transcending gratitude that we announce here what an inspiration both professors have been throughout our experience of building this shiny app. Their knowledge, understanding and genuine “care” for others is illuminated in everything they do! We, Group 8, are in forever debt for their teachings. Moreoever, we also want to thank TA, Chengliang Tang. There is not enough we can say about how much we thank heaven that he is our teaching assistance. His patience and understanding are unsurpassed. We are grateful for being his students.
