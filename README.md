# Applied Data Science Fall 2018 by Columbia University

This repository is the script for final project, "How to predict future price of a security", submitted to Advanced Data Science offered in Fall 2018 semester at Columbia University.

# Prerequisite

This project requires reader to have a broad range of knowledge including but not limited to (1) financial accounting, (2) time-series analysis, (3) predictive modeling skills, (4) coding in R, (5) design software package such as R Shiny, and (6) parallel computing using shell script.

# Abstract

Project summary: What is tomorrow's stock price? Under big data era, what searching technique can we use to grasp the useful information so that we can minimize our prediction error predicting a regression problem? This project studies price actions in capital market as a random walk from limit theorems. Through clear construction, we derive algorithms from a series of theorems to create standardized buy signals given a trader's committed frequency to participate in the market. Using such processed data, we can use influence measure, I-score, to select robust stock clusters to construct portfolio. Simulation result shows under the same risk profile a $1,000 initial investment returns $5,000 while the same time S&P500 returns less than $1,500. Empirical evidence show results of on average 97% error reduction.
